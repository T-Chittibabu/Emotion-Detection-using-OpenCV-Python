# Emotion-Detection-using-OpenCV-Python
Real-time Facial Emotion Detection using open-cv &amp; python.

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of seven categories, using open-cv,python & deeplearning concepts. The model is trained on the dataset by collection different images from google. This dataset consists of 7200 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with seven emotions - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

## Dependencies

Python 3, OpenCV, Tensorflow
NumPy,Keras,Pandas libraries
